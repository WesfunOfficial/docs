# Developer Intro

In Serpent OS, we rely heavily on the [D programming language](https://dlang.org) programming language,
and all of our tooling is developed publicly in our primary [GitHub space](https://github.com/serpent-os)

If you're using a Linux distribution other than Serpent OS or Solus, it is recommended to use the official
build of `ldc2` from dlang.org.

Visit [The Install Page](https://dlang.org/install.html) for more information.
