# Introduction

Welcome to Serpent OS!

We are so excited to have you on this journey and hope you enjoy! Currently our goal as a distribution is to create a vast and robust toolkit for developers and a polished and stable experience for end users.

We currently have two offically supported Desktop Enviornments or DE's

COSMIC
- Computer Operating System Main Interface Components or COSMIC for short is a up and coming Desktop Enviornment currently in a pre-alpha state created by System76. It is ideal for anyone who is wanting a sleak interface and options built in for different workflows, but who dont currently mind a bug or two

GNOME
- GNU Network Object Model Environment or GNOME for short has been a key player in the Linux Desktop space for some time. it is known for being modular and polished all at the same time. It is ideal for anyone wanting a more stable experience at the moment
