title: GNOME Desktop

At present, all Serpent OS ISOs default to the GNOME desktop, so no further action is
required. A future update to `lichen` (our installer) will introduce the user-selection
of the desktop environment, such as `COSMIC`. At that point this page will be updated with
installation details for GNOME.
