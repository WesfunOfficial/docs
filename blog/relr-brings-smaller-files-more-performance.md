`RELR` is an efficient method of storing relative relocations (but is not yet available in `glibc` upstream). This has a
significant reduction on file size often in the vicinity of 5% for libraries and even higher for PIE binaries. We also
take a look at the performance impact on enabling `RELR` and that looks really good too! Smaller files with more
performance - you **can** have your cake and eat it too!

# Delicious Size Savings

Everyone enjoys smaller files, especially when it's for free! `RELR` provides a very efficient method of storing
relative relocations where it only requires a few percent compared to storing them in the `.rela.dyn` section which is
what currently happens. However, it can't store everything so the `.rela.dyn` section remains (though much smaller).

Here's an example of the sections of `libLLVM-13.so` with and without `RELR`. Here we see the `.rela.dyn` section taking
up a whole 2MB! When enabling `RELR`, `.rela.dyn` shrinks down to just under 100KB while adding a new section
`.relr.dyn` which is just over 20KB! That's nearly a 1.9MB file size reduction, so you'll get smaller packages, smaller
updates and it will be even faster to create delta packages from our servers. For reference, some of the biggest files
have a `.rela.dyn` section over 10MB!

| Section   | Without RELR | With RELR  |
|:---------:|--------------|------------|
| .dynstr   |  2,285,738   |  2,285,723 |
| .rela.dyn |  2,006,472   |    97,464  |
| .relr.dyn |      -       |    21,688  |
| .text     | 28,708,290   | 28,708,386 |
| .dynamic  |      592     |      608   |
|           |              |            |
| Total     | 44,853,987   | 42,966,764 |

# Smaller, But at What Cost?

While most of the discussion about `RELR` is around the size savings, there's been very little in terms of the
performance numbers of enabling `RELR`. For most things, it's not going to make a noticeable difference, as it should
only really impact loading of binaries. There's one rule we have and that's to measure everything! We care about every
little detail where many 1-2% improvements can add up to significant gains.

First, we require a test to determine if we could detect changes between an `LLVM` built with `RELR` and one without.
The speed of the compiler is vital to a distro, where lackluster performance of the build system hurts all contributors
and anyone performing source based builds. `clang` in this example was built using a shared `libLLVM` so that it would
load the `RELR` section and it's large enough to be able to measure a difference in load times (if one exists). Building
`gettext` was the chosen test (total time includes tarball extraction, configure, make and make install stages), rather
than a synthetic binary loading test to reflect real world usage. The configure stage is very long when building
`gettext` so `clang` is called many times for short compiles. Lets take a look at the results:

```
no RELR:
[Build] Finished: 1 minute, 57 secs, 80 ms, 741 μs, and 2 hnsecs
[Build] Finished: 1 minute, 57 secs, 691 ms, 586 μs, and 4 hnsecs
[Build] Finished: 1 minute, 56 secs, 861 ms, 31 μs, and 8 hnsecs

RELR:
[Build] Finished: 1 minute, 55 secs, 244 ms, 213 μs, and 8 hnsecs
[Build] Finished: 1 minute, 55 secs, 400 ms, 158 μs, and 8 hnsecs
[Build] Finished: 1 minute, 55 secs, 775 ms, 40 μs, and 8 hnsecs

RELR+startup patch:
[Build] Finished: 1 minute, 54 secs, 979 ms, 166 μs, and 8 hnsecs
[Build] Finished: 1 minute, 54 secs, 820 ms, and 675 μs
[Build] Finished: 1 minute, 54 secs, 713 ms, 440 μs, and 3 hnsecs
```

Here we see the base configuration was able to build `gettext` in 117.21s on average. When we enabled `RELR` in our
`LLVM` build (all other packages were without `RELR` still), the average build time decreased by 1.74s! That does not
sound like a lot, but the time spent loading `clang` would only be a portion of the total, yet still gives a 1-2%
performance lift over the whole build. While we were reducing start up time, I ran another test, but this time adding a
patch to reduce paths searched on startup as well as enabling `RELR`. This patch reduced the average build time by a
further 0.63s!

That's a 2.37s reduction in the build just from improving the `clang` binary's load time.

# What This Means - RELR by Default

So what actually is `RELR`? I can't really do the topic justice, so will point you to a great blog post about RELR,
[Relative Relocations and RELR](https://maskray.me/blog/2021-10-31-relative-relocations-and-relr). It's quite technical
for the average reader, but definitely worth a read if you like getting into the details. To no surprise the author
(Fangrui Song) started the initial push for getting `RELR` support upstream in `glibc` (at the time of this post the
patch series has not yet been committed to `glibc` git).

What I can tell you, is that we've applied the requisite patches for `RELR` support and enabled `RELR` by default in
`boulder` for builds. Our container has been rebuilt and all is working well with `RELR` enabled. More measurements will
be done in future in the same controlled manner, particularly around PIE load times.

# Caveats - The Hidden Details

The performance benchmark was quite limited in terms of being an optimal case for `RELR` as `clang` is called thousands
of times in the build so on average improved load time by about 0.6-0.7ms. We can presume that using `RELR` on smaller
files is unlikely to regress load times. It definitely gives us confidence that it would be about the same or better in
most situations, but not noticeable or measurable in most use cases. Minimizing build times is a pretty significant
target for us, so even these small gains are appreciated.

The size savings can vary between packages and not everything can be converted into the `.relr.dyn` section. The current
default use of `RELR` is not without cost as it adds a version dependency on `glibc`. We will ensure we ship a sane
implementation that minimizes or removes such overhead.

It was also not straight forward to utilize `RELR` in Serpent. The pending upstream `glibc`
[patch series](https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2022-February/136290.html) included a patch which caused
issues when enabling `RELR` in Serpent OS (patch 3/5). As we utilize two toolchains, `gcc/bfd` and `clang/lld`, both
need to function independently to create outputs of a functional OS. However the part "Issue an error if there is a
DT_RELR entry without GLIBC_ABI_DT_RELR dependency nor GLIBC_PRIVATE definition." meant that `glibc` would **refuse to
load files linked by `lld` despite having the ability to load them**. `lld` has supported `RELR` for some time already,
but does not create the `GLIBC_ABI_DT_RELR` dependency that is required by `glibc`. I have added my
[feedback](https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2022-March/136773.html) to the patch set upstream. `lld` now has
support for this version dependency upstream if we ever decide to use it in future.

After dropping the patch and patching `bfd` to no longer generate the `GLIBC_ABI_DT_RELR` dependency either, I was
finally able to build both `glibc` and `LLVM` with the same patches. With overcoming that hurdle, rebuilding the rest of
the repository went without a hitch, so we are now enjoying `RELR` in all of our builds and is enabled by default.

There is even further scope for more size savings, by switching the `rela.dyn` section for the `rel.dyn` section (this
is what is used for 32-bit builds and one of the reasons files are smaller!). `lld` supports switching the section type,
but I don't believe `glibc` will read the output as it expects the `psABI` specified section (something `musl` can
handle though).

# The Cost of Adding GLIBC_ABI_DT_RELR

A quick check of two equivalent builds (one adding the `GLIBC_ABI_DT_RELR` version dependency and one not), there was an
increase of 34 bytes to the file's sections (18 bytes to `.dynstr` and 16 bytes to `.gnu.version_r`). It also means
having to validate that the `GLIBC_ABI_DT_RELR` version is present in the `libc` and that the file using `RELR` includes
this version dependency. This may not sound like much but it is completely unnecessary! Note that the testing provided
in this blog post is without `GLIBC_ABI_DT_RELR`.

Regardless of what eventuates, these negatives won't ship in Serpent OS. This will allow for us to support files that
include the version dependency (when appimage and other distros catch up) as it will still exist in `libc`, but we won't
have the version check in files, nor will `glibc` check that the version exists before loading for packages built by
`boulder`.
