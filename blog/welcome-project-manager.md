The Serpent OS team wishes to formally welcome Aydemir Ulaş Şahin to the core team in the primary
capacity of Project Manager. Aydemir will help us to coordinate and manage the project goals and
infrastructure, being responsible for certain "keys to the kingdom".

Aydemir has extensive experience with Linux, both as a user and developer, having worked in the
media industry for many years. Additionally he will be contributing to the core system, code
and packaging.

Our initial trio has been announced, and you can always access information on the current team
at the new [Team page](/team). Now that much of our groundwork has been laid, we can get on
with building the project. Check progress at the new [Roadmap](/roadmap) page.
