Yeah we did it again. Project is back with a bang and working
away so we revamped our website during our port to Bootstrap 5.

This wasn't just a visual update however, we've revamped much of
the **content** too. Look around the new homepage, we've linked new
pages explaining our project goals and vision.

Sure, we're not quite there **yet** but we're definitely seeing
exciting times here at Serpent OS. This is officially my 2nd week
back to full time work and we're making steady progress.

_Special thanks to the team and caasi (Jacob) for streamling the revamp_

Ttfn!
