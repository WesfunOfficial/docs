It took quite some effort, but I've purchased and built a dedicated office
space where I'll be working on Serpent OS daily. As my eldest son has just
started full time school, I have considerably more usable hours to do so!

Once the PVC shed was built, my wife and I deep cleaned it, fitted carpet,
added a chair and desk, and honestly it's an awesome little workspace.
Future plans will involve a dedicated power supply (twin 16A RCD split
on mobile home supply), ethernet connection, fans, etc.

This office space is what I was trying to build when I set out with the
Office Shed event goal on Open Collective, which we can now finally deem
successful.

# Broadband

I've signed up to broadband with ~40mbps min download, ~69mbps average,
just waiting for the engineer appointment to install a new master socket.

New day time availability, high speed internet and a dedicated office space
will mean drastically improved productivity as well as permitting live streams!

Remember, you can now join us on Matrix to have real time discussions or talk
with the team!
