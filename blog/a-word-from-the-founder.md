Well well, it's been a long time since I personally wrote a post.. :) So let's keep
this short and sweet, shall we? I'm returning to full time work on Serpent OS.

<!--truncate-->

The 6th of July will be my last day at my current employment having tendered my
30 day notice today. Despite having enjoyment at my current position, the reality
is that my passion and focus is Serpent OS.

I'm now in a transition process and will ramp up my efforts with Serpent OS.
Realistically I need to reduce the outgoing costs of the project and with
your help I can gain some level of financial support as we move through the
next stages of development. Worst case, I will only take on any part-time or
contractual gigs, allowing my primary focus to be Serpent OS.

I'll begin accelerating works and enabling community contribution so we can
get the derailed-alpha train back on the tracks.

I have absolute faith in this project, the community and our shared ability
to deliver the OS and tooling. To achieve it will require far more of my time
and I'm perfectly willing to give it.

Thank you all to everyone who has been supporting the project, it is now
time to deliver. Not just another run of the mill distribution but a technically
competent and usable distribution that is not only different but *better*.

Let's do this in the most grassroots and enjoyable way possible =)
